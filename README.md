# Olist Sales ELT Pipeline

## Project Overview

### Background
Olist Store, an e-commerce platform in Brazil, provides a public dataset that includes 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018, sourced from various marketplaces. The Sales Marketing department of Olist Store aims to monitor sales performance effectively. However, the current data is not yet integrated, making the analysis process time-consuming and inefficient. To address this issue, an automated data pipeline is required to perform scheduled extract, load, and transform (ELT) processes, ensuring seamless sales monitoring.

### Objective
This project aims to build an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline to efficiently manage and analyze e-commerce data.

## Problem Statement
- The data used for analysis is not yet integrated into a single system, resulting in inefficiencies and delays in business decision-making.
- A fully automated ELT pipeline is required to collect, clean, and present data in a format that is ready for periodic sales analysis.
- Olist Store's transactional data lacks integration, hindering efficient sales performance analysis.

## Proposed Solution
To overcome these challenges, this project will implement an ELT pipeline that automates data extraction, cleaning, and transformation processes, ensuring that the Sales Marketing department has real-time, structured, and accessible data for decision-making.
